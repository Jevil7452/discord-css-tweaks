# discord-css-tweaks

A small collection of various CSS tweaks to Discord to make the app better

# File descriptions

`shrink-unreads-bar.css` - shrinks and unrounds the unread messages bar at the top of the screen
`hide-custom-title-bar.css` - hides Discord's shitty custom titlebar. You'll need to have modded your Discord client to have the native titlebar before using this.
